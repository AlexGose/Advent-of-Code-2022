# Advent of Code 2022

These are Python solutions to the first 15 problems of the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).  These are just interesting and fun programming problems to work on.  In most cases I just wrote up a quick solution without worrying about readability or reusability.  Other times I spent time revising a solution to make it easier to read or reuse.  For part 2 of day 6, a number of alternative implementations are benchmarked.
